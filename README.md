# Karuna Coding Challenge

This challenge consists of four questions, each designed to test a different skillset which we consider crucial to being part of our early-stage team. This is not meant to be a whiteboard exercise or something to test your memorization skills. We want to see how you problem-solve as an engineer. Feel free to use your standard environment, tools, resources, etc. You can Google anything you'd like, use public libraries, and do all thing things you'd normally do. We only request that your submission be self-contained (use standard mechansims such as a `requirements.txt` or `Gemfile` to pull in external dependencies if needed), and that you don't get anyone else to help you (no asking friends for tips and write all your own code).

The four categories we're testing for are:

1. Code Quality
2. SQL
3. Systems Architechture
4. Web

Additionally, we will ask you to submit a code sample. This should be the piece of code that you are most proud of. You could be proud of this code because of how elegant, efficient, or otherwise beautiful it is. Please include with it a brief description of what the code does, and why you're so proud of it.

## Environment

Currently, this challenge supports code using the following languages and depency managers:

1. Python3 (pip, `requirements.txt`)
2. Ruby (bundler, `Gemfile`)
3. Javascript (yarn, `package.json`)

Let us know if you'd like to use a different language for any of the questions, and we'll make it happen!

The SQL question is run against an up-to-date Postgres instance.

## Submission

Please use the following procedure to submit your response to this challenge. While the repository is shared, your submission will be encrypted, and your commit will be anonymous.

1. Clone this repo
2. Run [`new_submission.sh`](scripts/new_submission.sh) to generate a directory for your submission
3. Place your submissions for each question in the relevant sub-directory
4. Run [`finalize_submission.sh`](scripts/finalize_submission.sh) to encrypt your submission, commit it, and push it to a new branch
5. Email us and let us know you have submitted!

If you need up update your submission, please use [`amend_submission.sh`](scripts/amend_submission.sh).
