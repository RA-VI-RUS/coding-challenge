# My Favorite Code Sample

My favorite code sample is a bus traffic analyzer that is lost to the mists of time, but I'm including this little app because it uses the Negamax algorithm to produce an unbeatable tic-tac-toe game.  Probably because I'm not much of a gamer, I had never heard of Minimax, Negamax, or any of the related game tree search algorithms before I did this little project.  The interesting bit is on lines 187 - 211.  I've committed all the source files, but you can play it at codepen: https://codepen.io/tprsca/pen/LGqLaM
